# Simple Linear Regression

Comprehensive guide to Simple Linear Regression with practical examples and implementations.

## Overview

Simple Linear Regression models the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y) using the equation: **y = β₀ + β₁x**

## Contents

### Notebooks
- **01_basics.ipynb** - Mathematical fundamentals and theory
- **02_salary_prediction.ipynb** - Practical example with salary dataset
- **03_implementation.ipynb** - Build regression model from scratch

### Datasets
- **salary_data.csv** - Employee salary based on years of experience

## Key Formulas

**Linear Equation:**
```
y = β₀ + β₁x
```

**Slope:**
```
β₁ = Σ((x - x̄)(y - ȳ)) / Σ((x - x̄)²)
```

**Intercept:**
```
β₀ = ȳ - β₁x̄
```

**R² Score:**
```
R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)
```
